# Dgql

Dgql is simple interface to put between graphql clients and your dgraph instance. It accepts a limited subset of the GraphQL specification and maps requests to GraphQL+- requests.

The current state of this library is initial exploration. It library only maps to GraphQL+-. In the future, it will accept handlers to transform data as its coming in and leaving the system.
