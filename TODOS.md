Jago Studio is a currently a community of one individual. The goal of the community is to use the intersection of life and business and technology as a way to practice being a good person.

Jago's possibilities are endless, but these are the early days. It's not worth following those paths now.

However, if you want to talk about solving problems with technology or need help doing so, feel free to reach out: isaac@jago.studio.
